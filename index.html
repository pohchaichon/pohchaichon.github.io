                    <p>I am currently an MPhil student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Professor Eric Lo.
                    My primary area of research revolves around high performance database components (e.g. index), database on new hardware, and machine learning in database.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from CUHK in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (First Class Honours). During that time, I went on an exchange study at University of California, Davis. I was awarded Belt and Road Scholarship (for Thai students) by HKSAR government to support my entire undergraduate studies.</p>

                    <p>We are exploring various database components on ARM processors. Major cloud vendors has been offering more ARM-based servers due to its cost efficiency, and to that end, we hope to accelerate the adoption of ARM-based cloud. With its unique characteristics (weak-ordered memory model, NUMA, large core counts, etc.) compared to x86 processors, we aim to study the implications and considerations when implementing a database system on ARM-based server.</p>
